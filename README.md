# LifeStats

Private, single-user Google Health companion. FastAPI owns domain behavior and integrations. Next.js renders Today. PostgreSQL stores local application data plus rebuildable Google Health projections.

## Runtime

- Python 3.12+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy async, Alembic
- Celery and Redis for sync work
- Next.js, React, TypeScript, TanStack Query
- PostgreSQL 17
- Caddy same-origin proxy

```

`main.py` creates the application. `api/router.py` composes module routers.
Backend modules are self-contained. Routers own HTTP mechanics, schemas own
request/response validation, services own orchestration and business rules,
repositories own database queries, and models own ORM mappings. Pure domain
rules remain framework-independent. Google-specific transport, registry, sync
tasks, and persistence stay inside its module. Dashboard remains a first-class
module and `/api/v1/dashboard` route.

## Source of truth

- Supported health writes go to Google Health first.
- Successful remote writes are reconciled into local projections.
- Local projection failure never overrides remote truth.

## Local development

Requirements: Python 3.12+, Node.js 24, npm, and OrbStack.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
uv sync --extra dev
npm install
uv run alembic upgrade head
uv run app
npm run dev
```

Run PostgreSQL, Redis, API, Celery worker, Celery scheduler, web, and proxy with OrbStack:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. First setup requires `SETUP_TOKEN`. After account creation, setup permanently returns 404.

## Verification

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy
uv run pytest
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run openapi:check
docker compose build
```

## Production deployment checklist

- Serve the proxy through HTTPS. Production session cookies are secure-only.
- Replace every `.env` placeholder.
- Keep `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` backed up; rotation needs an explicit token migration.
- Set Google's authorized callback to the exact HTTPS `REDIRECT_URI`.
- Start PostgreSQL, Redis, API, worker, and scheduler before connecting Google Health.
- Leave webhooks disabled until the public HTTPS webhook URL and subscriber are ready.
- Back up PostgreSQL and the encryption key separately.

Production configuration fails fast when required OAuth, database, Redis, callback,
setup, or encryption values are missing. Enabling webhooks also requires the full
webhook configuration.

### Logging

- `LOG_LEVEL` controls API and worker verbosity; default is `INFO`.
- Production API and worker logs use JSON on stdout.
- Every API response returns `X-Request-ID`; trusted incoming IDs are preserved.
- Google Health logs contain lifecycle metadata, never tokens or raw health payloads.
- Proxy access logging stays disabled so OAuth callback codes never enter logs.
- Docker rotates each service at five 10 MB files.

## Fresh database cutover

`20260723_0001_init` is a fresh PostgreSQL baseline. It does not import the old
database.

1. Stop existing writers.
2. Back up and restore-test the old PostgreSQL database.
3. Preserve encryption keys, Google OAuth settings, and prior image.
4. Start a new `lifestats` database or volume.
5. Run `uv run alembic upgrade head`.
6. Create the private account and reconnect Google Health.
7. Start worker and scheduler; verify 39 sync jobs and initial polling.
8. Keep webhooks disabled until polling and signature tests pass.
9. Run `google-health-subscriber inspect`, then `apply`.
10. Keep the old database and image through the rollback window.

Future contexts—Fitness, meditation, food, biology, Alfred, Telegram, and Todoist—remain documentation-only until requested.
